    abstract = {We consider tracking as a binary classification problem, where an ensemble of weak classifiers is trained online to distinguish between the object and the background. The ensemble of weak classifiers is combined into a strong classifier using AdaBoost. The strong classifier is then used to label pixels in the next frame as either belonging to the object or the background, giving a confidence map. The peak of the map and, hence, the new position of the object, is found using mean shift. Temporal coherence is maintained by updating the ensemble with new weak classifiers that are trained online during tracking. We show a realization of this method and demonstrate it on several video sequences},

    abstract = {In this paper, we present a system that integrates fully automatic scene geometry estimation, 2D object detection, 3D localization, trajectory estimation, and tracking for dynamic scene interpretation from a moving vehicle. Our sole input are two video streams from a calibrated stereo rig on top of a car. From these streams, we estimate structure-from-motion (SfM) and scene geometry in real-time. In parallel, we perform multi-view/multi-category object recognition to detect cars and pedestrians in both camera images. Using the SfM self-localization, 2D object detections are converted to 3D observations, which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame. A subsequent tracking module analyzes the resulting 3D observations to find physically plausible spacetime trajectories. Finally, a global optimization criterion takes object-object interactions into account to arrive at accurate 3D localization and trajectory estimates for both cars and pedestrians. We demonstrate the performance of our integrated system on challenging real-world data showing car passages through crowded city areas.},

It approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster.
This is achieved by replying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life object recognition application. Both show SURF's strong performance.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we describe an unsupervised learning framework to segment a scene into semantic regions and to build semantic scene models from long-term observations of moving objects in the scene. First, we introduce two novel similarity measures for comparing trajectories in far-field visual surveillance. The measures simultaneously compare the spatial distribution of trajectories and other attributes, such as velocity and object size, along the trajectories. They also provide a comparison confidence measure which indicates how well the measured image-based similarity approximates true physical similarity. We also introduce novel clustering algorithms which use both similarity and comparison confidence. Based on the proposed similarity measures and clustering methods, a framework to learn semantic scene models by trajectory analysis is developed. Trajectories are first clustered into vehicles and pedestrians, and then further grouped based on spatial and velocity distributions. Different trajectory clusters represent different activities. The geometric and statistical models of structures in the scene, such as roads, walk paths, sources and sinks, are automatically learned from the trajectory clusters. Abnormal activities are detected using the semantic scene models. The system is robust to low-level tracking errors.},
